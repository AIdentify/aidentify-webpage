                AIdentify is a tech company focused on the development of solutions for the automated surveillance of vector mosquitoes using specialized electronic sensors and Artificial Intelligence. The solutions developed by AIdentify within the scope of Mosquitoramento involve automated monitoring of mosquito traps, data collection from traps instrumented with our sensors, to real-time visualization of mosquito captures at various levels.
                <br>
                With its main project, Mosquitoramento, it has won various calls for proposals, such as Centelha in Rio Grande do Sul (BR), first place in the Health Alliance competition organized by UNICRED - POA, third place in the Flex innovation challenge in Sorocaba - SP, and first place in the CASS Latin American competition, presenting the Project in Texas - USA in 2022.

                Our system seeks to combine Internet of Things (IoT) technology and convolutional neural networks to identify Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, in order to benefit from the advantages offered by modern technology, such as low operational costs, speed, and practicality in data visualization to identify and predict the presence and movement of this mosquito. 
                <br><br>
                In this sense, Mosquitoramento brings a smart and innovative solution to assist in combating the mosquito. Our product proposes the detection of Aedes aegypti through the capture of environmental audio and the processing of the recordings obtained. The sensed data are analyzed with a convolutional neural network that, trained with information previously collected in earlier studies, performs the identification of the mosquito and generates a real-time detection signal to the server, integrating it into a dashboard that contains the map of the affected regions. 
                The project is currently in its pilot phase, having been deployed in select cities.
